# Geospatial Analysis of Non-English Speaking Households in Durham Region

This project analyzes **non-English speaking households** in the **Durham Region of Ontario**, using health data from Durham Region’s open data portal. The analysis integrates geospatial mapping with **Foursquare Studio**, visualizations created in **Excel**, and design elements from **Canva** to build a comprehensive **infographic**.

## Project Overview  
Understanding the distribution of non-English speaking households is essential for planning public services and community outreach. This project:
- Utilizes a **thematic map** from **Foursquare Studio** to highlight geographic trends.
- Presents a **doughnut chart** to show proportional representation.
- Includes a **bar chart** for comparing regional differences.
- Combines these elements into a visually engaging **infographic**.

## Key Insights
- **Higher concentrations** of non-English speaking households are found in municipalities closer to **Toronto**.
- Thematic mapping reveals **localized variations**, with some neighborhoods having a higher number of non-English speaking households despite the overall region having a lower average.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Foursquare Studio** – for geospatial mapping and thematic visualization.
- **Microsoft Excel** – for data preparation, cleaning, and visualization.
- **Canva** – for designing the final infographic.

## Challenges & Learnings
- **Foursquare Studio UI**: Navigating the interface and formatting the map for clear presentation posed some challenges, due to the cluttured formatting options.

- **Combining Multiple Visuals**: Designing the infographic in Canva required strategically arranging the thematic map, bar chart, and doughnut chart to ensure clear storytelling, visual hierarchy, and readability without overcrowding the layout.
